<p>This is a newly created index file inside a newly created directory.</p>
<br>
<p>The directory was made by using the command mkdir Localrepo.</p>
<br>
<p>After the creation of the repo we changed it into a git enabled repo by using git init command.</p>
<br>
<p>Then we created a new html and css file inside LocalRepo.</p>
<br>
<p>This code is being written after donig all that.</p>
<br>
<p>We used git status to check the status of the newly created files.This file is untracked upto this point.</p>
<br>
<p>Now we stage these files by using git add filename1 filename2</p>
<br>
<p>the we commit the newly created files using git commit -m "Remarks about the commit" </p>
<br>
<p>After commiting the intial files, its time to push the changes to github.</p>
<br>
<p>We create a remote repo on github.</p> 
<br>
<p>The name of the remote repo need not be the same as that of local repo on git.</p>
<br>
<p>Do not initialise a README.md file, othersie we will have to bring that file in our local system (git) as well</p>
<br>
<p>Refer Diary Notes before you proceed any further.</p>
<br>
<p>NOTE: Instead of git push origin push we used git push -u origin main. -u flag means to set upstream.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are working on a long project then it's better to use the -u flag in the first push itself.</p>
<br>
<p>Later on we can push the changes onto the same branch by just using git push alone.</p>
<br>
<p>Just like I pushed the change till this line</p> 
<br>

<br>
<p>This is a test brach created for merge test.</p>
<br>
<p>This text is written to indicate that we are merging main and feature2</p>
