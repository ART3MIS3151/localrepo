<p>This is a newly created index file inside a newly created directory.</p>
<br>
<p>The directory was made by using the command mkdir Localrepo.</p>
<br>
<p>After the creation of the repo we changed it into a git enabled repo by using git init command.</p>
<br>
<p>Then we created a new html and css file inside LocalRepo.</p>
<br>
<p>This code is being written after donig all that.</p>
<br>
<p>We used git status to check the status of the newly created files.This file is untracked upto this point.</p>
<br>
<p>Now we stage these files by using git add filename1 filename2</p>
<br>
<p>the we commit the newly created files using git commit -m "Remarks about the commit" </p>
